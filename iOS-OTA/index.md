##### AppStoreIsh iOS Apps
###### These are builds of the iOS app that are as close as possible to the versions released to the app store, with the exception that they are debug builds-- and by default will use the staging environment. Shake the app, to get the developer dashboard, and you can also use the production environment. These builds are distinguished from the app store released builds by the green stripe to their lower right with the word "STORE".

##### Installing
###### To install these builds, you must tap on a link below from your iOS device's browser (or email app on your device if you have the link in an email). It is possible you may need to delete your prior AppStoreIsh app beforehand. To install these builds, your iOS device must have been listed in the Provisioning Profile with which these apps were built. Contact engineering if you have a new device, and need that added.
